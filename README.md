This project recommends enhancing simple models rather than implementing more complex ones. In this example, I used clinical data to predict (classify) the likelihood of future heart attacks. I initially implemented a straightforward Logistic Regression model and later added an interaction term justified by the high correlation between predictor variables. The improved model demonstrated better performance across various indicators.

You can see these results and their justifications in the accompanying PowerPoint presentation.
